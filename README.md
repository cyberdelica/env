# env

An experiment in keeping a public dotfiles repository, purged of personal data. This project is intended to "encourage" me to be more organised, and thus, will be in constant flux, deciding upon the best approach/structure as I go.

## overview

What's in here?

### proposed directory structure

- `/bin/` &ndash; extremely simple shell scripts that don't warrant their own repository
- `/etc/` &ndash; undecided
- `/lib/` &ndash; undecided
- `/inc/` &ndash; undecided
- `/cfg/` &ndash; undecided
- `/src/` &ndash; patches for various projects (mostly suckless utilities)
- `/key/` &ndash; pgp public keys

## to do

- [ ] finalise directory structure.

## licence

The entire repository is placed into the public domain.
